	<h2>Vague and Non-Comprehensive Patch Notes</h2>
</div>
<div class="patch">
	<ul><h3>2/7/26</h3>
		<li>Added insecurities of various varieties to each gender, which gives some missing dimensions to their motivations
		<ul><li>Added insecurity parent node into Tough. I'm unsure about this placement, as I am unsure if anyone owns the overall insecurity—I wanted to tie them all together. I may remove it</li>
		<li>Added Elegant's desire to feel seen and understood, and various ways she wants to. Elegant now feels more in line with Everyone Else but still in need of another pass</li>
		<li>Added Hot's insecurity around the opinions of others and her desire to be liked</li>
		<li>Refined Cute's insecurity to relational insecurity</li>
		<li>Tough's experience of insecurity needs more work, as insecurity does feel motivating to her but what flavor of insecurity she experiences is unclear currently</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Added Cute's rebelliousness and her indifference to the judgement of others. Looking for a better way to phrase this since she likes being liked but doesn't care or is defiant in the face of dislike or disapproval</li>
		<li>Swapped vigilance back to Elegant from Cute, feels better as (partially) a way for Elegant (or the system?) to protect Cute from feeling bad and separately as a way to consider others</li>
		<li>Slightly updated and added to Pretty</li><ul>
		<li>Labeled more nodes as also Pretty's. Currently, I do not post her graph so one cannot see this</li></ul>
		<li>Removed some question marks</li>
		
	</ul>
